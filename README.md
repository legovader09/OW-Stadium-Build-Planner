## Credits

Website, and text content ripped by myself.

Assets ripped by [Leafcyn](https://leafycn.carrd.co/) (BIG THANKS, WOULDNT HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOUR HELP)

## Asset Usage

Since it took an awful lot of time and effort to rip these assets from the stadium game mode, it would be wonderful if you credit myself and/or [Leafcyn](https://leafycn.carrd.co/) in your project! :)
